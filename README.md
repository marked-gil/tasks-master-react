### **Version Control**

**Git** was a crucial tool used to track changes that were made in the repository. The following git commands were mainly used in developing this program:

* `git status` — to show the status of the repository by displaying the files that have been staged and are ready for commit, those that are not, and those that are untracked. 
* `git add <file name>` — to add file or changes in the file to the staging area before they can be committed
* `git commit -m "message"` — to add/record files or changes to the local repository
* `git push` — to upload the local repository to the remote repository, such as GitHub

### **Heroku Deployment**
